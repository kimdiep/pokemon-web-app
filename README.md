## Project: pokemon-web-app

This is my personal project to create a one-page Pokemon web app built using Vanilla JS and using data from the Pokemon TCG API. The purpose of this project is to learn about JSON, accessing API endpoints and understanding API documentation. It is adapted from the fantastic tutorial by Tania Rascia on connecting to the Studio Ghibli API using JavaScript.

The Pokemon-Mimkyu app can be accessed here:
